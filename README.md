# Author Comments: 
I had various technical issues throughout the development of this project with my computer. I did what I could in the limited amount of time. 
# With more time, the following would be implemented:
- Unit testing 
- Proper registration with user account field verification
- Password hashing, with the hashed password being what is stored in the database
- Unique usernames only with limitation on characters. 
- Login function implemented properly using ASP.NET cache to remember user is logged in.
- One owner can have many bank accounts
- Account lists on page upon login
- Add another bank account once user is logged in
- ASP.NET API with functioning UI
